This is a Quarto website that I made for my lab for DSCI 521.

In case you come here and you are NOT from the MDS course at UBC, 
you could be lost or maybe you are one big curious cat!

Hello, I'm Sienko! Most people think I am from planet Earth, but I am only came here a few years ago disguised as a cute baby. In actual fact, I am from a tranquil planet that is millions of lightyears away from here. Here on Earth, I'm trying to speak your languages. Most recently, I am aiming to be fluent in _Python_ (do you think whoever came up with the name hated or liked the snake?) and _R_ (this one was invented by someone who hates typing...although, since R is always written in uppercase - it must be boring when you have to keep using Shift to type the name?).

How could I forget that I am also learning cool stuff like this formula?

$$
\log \bigg[ \frac{p(X)}{1 - p(X)} \bigg] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
$$
