Most people think I am from planet Earth, but I am only came here a few years ago disguised as a cute baby. In actual fact, I am from a tranquil planet that is millions of lightyears away from here. Here on Earth, I’m trying to speak your languages. Most recently, I am aiming to be fluent in Python (do you think whoever came up with the name hated or liked the snake?) and R (this one was invented by someone who hates typing…although, since R is always written in uppercase - it must be boring when you have to keep using Shift to type the name?).\nHow could I forget that I am also learning cool stuff like this formula?\n\\[\n\\log \\bigg[ \\frac{p(X)}{1 - p(X)} \\bigg] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X\n\\]"
